# salvor Development Rules

These rules are MANDATORY. They supplement `CLAUDE.md` and take precedence over default behavior.

## Protocol Tiers

- **Core Protocol (always on):** context loading and hub/spoke reading (§6.1), L1/L2 memory maintenance (§0.2–0.3), user-gated capture approval (§2, §7), context recovery (§1), security and git-safe operation (§9), canonical ownership and memory layers (§8), distributed-brain IDs, post-pull reconcile, and the recurring brain audit (§10), and vendor portability via thin adapters. Salvor may update concise operational state as work progresses. It must ask before promoting a decision, domain learning, learned failure, or deferred finding into the repository's durable shared engineering record.
- **Optional Strict Engineering Defaults:** these defaults are optional, editable, and project-specific; disabling them does not break Salvor Core. They cover component build counters (§0.1, §3), env-var conventions (§4.4, §6.2), the branch-deletion rule (§6.11), the dev-first branch flow (§6.12), container permission rules (§5.1), impact analysis before every edit (§4.3), the >100-line search-before-read limit (§4.1), mirror parity (§0.5, §6.3), and the pre-merge brain reconcile (§0.6, §10.2).
- **[EXPERIMENTAL] Beta features:** agentic provisional capture and the archive (§10.5–§10.6) are beta, **default OFF**, and opt-in only by editing their config lines. They may change based on community feedback and are never required by Core or Strict behavior.

## 0. CRITICAL: Task Termination Protocol

Before declaring any task complete, verify and execute this checklist. No task is complete until `VERSION.md` is bumped when required, spokes are synced, and L1/L2 are updated.

1. **Version Check:** If logic or owned content in a component changed, increment its build ID in `VERSION.md`, update the date, and add a component-specific history entry. Versions derive from `VERSION.md`; do not hardcode them in source. On a feature branch, record the history row with the literal build ID `pending` instead — real numbers are assigned at integration (§3, §10.2).
2. **L1 Sync:** Update `.salvor/active_state.md` in dense shorthand and keep it under 50 lines.
3. **L2 Sync:** Update `.salvor/active_state_verbose.md` immediately after L1 with full reasoning, logs, and nuance. L2 is detailed but curated, not unbounded: when it exceeds ~1,500 lines or at release milestones, condense the oldest resolved sections — keep durable conclusions, evidence references, and commit/test/issue IDs; drop raw noise. Never persist material listed in §9.1.
4. **Spoke Sync:** Update the changed component's `CLAUDE.md`; update `.salvor/DOMAIN_REF.md` for domain logic and `.salvor/INFRA.md` for infrastructure. Do not put component-specific detail in root `CLAUDE.md`.
5. **Repository ↔ Website Parity:** Canonical public claims live in `README.md`, `SETUP_PROMPT.md`, and `docs/VENDOR_ADAPTERS.md`. The deployable static site is `site/` on `main`; `.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys it from `main` via GitHub Actions. Before deploying site changes, run direct Playwright checks at desktop, tablet, small-phone, and 320px sizes; new page sections/interactions/visual elements require explicit operator design approval. Pushing/deploying remain operator-controlled. See §6.3.
6. **Brain Reconcile (feature branches):** if this task ends in a PR or a merge into the integration branch, fetch the target branch and run the §10.2 Brain Reconcile ceremony against it BEFORE the merge.

## 1. Context Recovery Procedure

If the operator requests context recovery or a logic loop occurs:

1. Stop all code generation.
2. Re-read `.salvor/active_state_verbose.md` from the beginning.
3. Compare current logic against Learned Failures in `.salvor/DOMAIN_REF.md` and L1/L2.
4. Summarize the source of confusion before proceeding.

## 2. Continued Learning Protocol

This protocol covers the first two capture classes: **Decision / Domain Learning** and **Learned Failure (`LF:<slug>`)**. (The third class, **Deferred Finding**, is covered by §7.) Its shared record is vendor-agnostic repository Markdown; thin adapters make it vendor-portable without forking that record.

Every domain discovery, hypothesis falsification, validation, vendor/model verdict, parameter learning, evidence-backed bakeoff, dependency probe, technique validation, Learned Failure, deliberate design decision or load-bearing invariant, or durable taxonomy clarification is a mandatory save checkpoint.

At each trigger, pause and ask verbatim — the phrasing that matches the subtype:

> "Save this as a domain learning? (yes/no)" — an empirical finding (**Domain Learning** → `.salvor/domain-learnings/`)
>
> "Record this as a design decision? (yes/no)" — a design decision / invariant (**Design Decision** → `.salvor/decisions/`)

Do not infer the answer, batch unrelated discoveries, or defer the prompt.

On `yes`:

1. **Dedupe by subject first:** search the matching registry/index (and `DOMAIN_REF.md`) by Subject tags — not just title or slug. If an artifact with overlapping subject and the same claim exists, surface it and ask whether to augment instead of duplicating (same contract as §7).
2. Create `.salvor/domain-learnings/YYYY-MM-DD-[CATEGORY]-[OUTCOME].md` (ID `DL:<kebab-slug>`, or `LF:<kebab-slug>` for a Learned Failure spec) following its README, including hypothesis, evidence, datasets, verdict, and cross-links — or, for a design decision, `.salvor/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md` (ID `DEC:<kebab-slug>`; Context, Decision, Rationale, Invariant, Coupling, Alternatives). Every artifact opens with the structured header — ID / Subject / Claim / Evidence date / Status (§10.1).
3. **TOC update:** add it to the matching chronological index:
   `.salvor/domain-learnings/README.md` for empirical findings, or
   `.salvor/decisions/README.md` for design decisions.
4. Update `.salvor/DOMAIN_REF.md` as current truth, including any new or revised `LF:<slug>` entry.
5. Update affected root context, component spoke, L1, L2, and `.serena/memories/`.
6. Report every touched file for end-to-end verification.

On `no`, acknowledge and continue without saving any partial artifact.

## 3. Version Increment Rules

| Component | Owned Scope | Source of Truth | Derived Constant |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| core | `SETUP_PROMPT.md` | `VERSION.md` → `CORE:XX` | `CORE_BUILD` |
| ghpage | `site/` static site, deployed from `main` via `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | `VERSION.md` → `GHPAGE:XX` | `GHPAGE_BUILD` |
| docs | `README.md` and `docs/` | `VERSION.md` → `DOCS:XX` | `DOCS_BUILD` |
| bench | `benchmarks/` benchmark subsystem (isolated; not installed by normal setup) | `VERSION.md` → `BENCH:XX` | `BENCH_BUILD` |

- A change bumps its owning component and receives its own history entry. Mixed changes bump every affected component independently.
- Each bump carries a bulleted change list.
- **Counters advance only on the integration branch** (`dev`; see §6.12). `main` is the release branch and receives promoted feature groups, not direct feature work. Work committed directly to the integration branch bumps immediately — the solo flow is unchanged. On a feature branch, add the history row with the literal build ID `pending` (e.g. `| 2026-08-05 | CORE:pending | change summary |`) and leave the JSON header, "Build IDs" line, L1 header, and spoke build lines untouched. The merge (§10.2 Brain Reconcile) assigns real numbers — one bump per affected component per integration — and rewrites the `pending` rows in the merge commit, so parallel branches never race on a counter.
- All version bumps are logged in `VERSION.md` first. No hardcoded component versions in source.

## 4. Search & Tools

1. **Search before read:** do not read any file over 100 lines without first using `rg`, `find_symbol`, or `get_symbols_overview` to target relevant ranges.
2. **Priority:** use Serena MCP symbolic tools first for code structure when the Serena MCP is responding; fall back to `rg`/glob/manual review when Serena cannot resolve the need or the MCP is not responding, and do not claim Serena results when it was not available.
3. **Impact before edits:** when the GitNexus MCP is active, impact analysis before edits is required — before modifying a function, class, or method, run GitNexus impact analysis and report blast radius, and run GitNexus change detection before committing. When it is not active, state that explicitly, use the best available structural search/review fallback (Serena symbols, `rg`, manual review), and never fabricate MCP results.
4. **App name:** use `APP_NAME`, defaulting to `salvor`; do not add a separate hardcoded app-name constant.

## 5. Infrastructure & Safety

1. Docker/container build, up/down, or restart requires explicit operator permission because parallel sessions may be active.
2. Calls that mutate production or external state, cost money, or touch shared infrastructure require explicit operator permission.
3. See §9 for never-persist rules and git-safe operation.

## 6. Coding Required Practices

1. Read root `CLAUDE.md`, the relevant spoke, `RULES.md`, and L1 before changing a component.
2. Do not hardcode volatile values such as versions, run modes, or endpoints; wire them to variables or canonical manifests.
3. **Repository ↔ website parity:** repository documentation is authoritative and the site is its semantic presentation mirror. The deployable static site is `site/` on `main`; `.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys it from `main` via GitHub Actions. If a canonical change needs a new page element, synchronization stops for explicit design approval. Before deploying site changes, run direct Playwright checks across desktop, tablet, small-phone, and 320px narrow consumers. Pushing/deploying remain operator-controlled.
4. Traverse every related code path. A new parameter or behavior must be wired into configuration, UI, reporting, import/export, and all consumers. Stop and ask when uncertain.
5. Numerically sensitive changes require an explicit smoke run before completion or a stated reason the smoke test cannot run.
6. Verify long-running and observability processes are alive (`ps`, `kill -0`, `wc -l`) before trusting output; use mid-run checkpoints for long jobs.
7. At external API boundaries, pass the domain-correct identifier (`slug` ≠ `id` ≠ `external-id`); consult documentation or proxy handlers when uncertain.
8. Every cache key includes every input that changes output, including model name, prompt-version hash, and schema version.
9. The Learned Failure is the atomic unit of work. Upgrade every fix site registered under an `LF:<slug>` entry together; record new mirror sites as LF amendments.
10. Production-affecting changes involving money, customer data, external mutations, or shared infrastructure require operator diff acknowledgement before deployment.
11. Merged branches are deleted locally and remotely in the same task as the merge. Deletion is the **reviewer/merger's** responsibility, not the author's (§6.12 step 6). Long-lived integration branches (`dev`, `main`) require operator confirmation and are never deleted.
12. **Branch flow [STRICT].** Work branches from `dev`, never from `main`.
    1. Branch from `dev`. Name it `feat/<slug>` or `bug/<slug>` with a meaningful slug. Once a branch represents a GitHub issue, the name carries the issue ID: `feat/3_evaluate-agent-plugins-1.0`.
    2. Implement on the branch.
    3. **Before requesting review, sync `dev` into the branch and resolve conflicts there.** This is the §0.6 / §10.2 pre-merge Brain Reconcile trigger: the author reconciles knowledge before a reviewer sees it, so dedupe lands before the textual conflict.
    4. Open a PR back to base branch `dev`.
    5. An adjacent developer reviews and approves.
    6. The **reviewer** merges into `dev` and deletes the merged branch (§6.11). When one person is both author and reviewer, that responsibility travels with the reviewer role.
    7. `dev` promotes to `main` in controlled feature groups. `main` = release branch; `dev` = integration branch (§3).

    If asked to merge a feature branch directly into `main`, do not proceed. Ask verbatim:

    > "SOP is feature → dev → main. Merge into dev instead? (yes / no — override)"


## 7. Out-of-Scope Finding Capture (Deferred Finding)

This is the third capture class: **Deferred Finding**. When work surfaces an unrelated bug, risk, or debt item, pause and ask verbatim:

> "Log this to .salvor/DEFERRED_TODOS.md? (yes/no)"

Bundle only findings that emerge together. On `yes`, read the ledger and deduplicate by subject first; a match with a `closed` entry reopens it (`Status: live`) instead of adding a new slug. If new, record it under a self-allocating slug ID (`### deferred:<kebab-slug> — <short title>`; never a sequential number, §10.1) with subject tags, location, issue, six-month severity, suggested fix, reason deferred, and `Status: live`. Do not derail the current task. When fixed, never delete the entry (§10.1): set its `Status` to `closed <date>` and reference the stable ID in the fixing commit (`closes deferred:<slug>`).

## 8. Memory layers & canonical ownership [CORE]

- **Shared and Git-tracked does not mean co-canonical.** Every durable fact has one canonical owner; other shared files link or summarize. One-owner model: `.salvor/` artifacts own their engineering knowledge; L1 (`.salvor/active_state.md`) = concise current state; L2 (`.salvor/active_state_verbose.md`) = curated recovery history; `.salvor/DOMAIN_REF.md` = current domain facts + failure registry; decision artifacts (`.salvor/decisions/`) = design rationale; domain-learning artifacts (`.salvor/domain-learnings/`) = validated empirical discoveries; postmortems = incident/failure evidence; `.salvor/DEFERRED_TODOS.md` = deferred findings; GitNexus = machine-derived code structure; Serena = symbol retrieval + concise pointers (not a canonical fork); Spec Kit = its own specs/plans; vendor entrypoints (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md`) route to canonical records and are NOT knowledge forks. This one-owner model is consistent with `SETUP_PROMPT.md` §8.
- **Per-user and optional:** Claude auto-memory under `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`. It is not shared or canonical and must never hold team truth.

## 9. Security & Git-safe operation [CORE]

1. **NEVER persist** to any memory/knowledge file: API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys, cookies, `.env` contents, credential-bearing URLs, customer PII, production datasets, unredacted logs, dependency dumps, large build output, or hidden model reasoning. **Redact before writing.** Summarize command output — keep evidence, conclusions, and commit/test/issue IDs; drop the noise.
2. `.gitignore` does not remove already-committed data. If credentials were ever committed: revoke them AND remediate git history — ignoring the file afterward is not a fix.
3. **Git-safe operation:** never blanket-stage (no catch-all add flags, no staging `.`), never commit without explicit approval, never silently overwrite files or another tool's managed sections. Stage explicit path lists; show `git diff --cached` before any commit you were asked to make.

## 10. Distributed Brain: IDs, Reconcile & Audit [CORE; §10.2 trigger 1 STRICT]

The brain travels through Git. Parallel branches, agents, and worktrees can capture semantically duplicate or contradictory knowledge under different names, and shared single-file surfaces conflict textually. This section keeps the brain single-truth with no central ID authority.

### 10.1 Knowledge IDs [CORE]

- Every durable knowledge artifact has a **self-allocating slug ID** — `<CLASS>:<kebab-slug>` — assigned at capture time: `LF:` (Learned Failure), `DL:` (Domain Learning), `DEC:` (Design Decision), `PM:` (Postmortem), `deferred:` (Deferred Finding). **Never a sequential number** — no ID allocation may read shared state.
- Every artifact opens with the **structured header** (the semantic-dedupe key): **ID** · **Subject** (tags: the system/vendor/component the claim is about) · **Claim** (one-line invariant) · **Evidence date** · **Status** (`live` | `superseded-by: <id>` | `archived` (§10.6) | `closed <date>` (deferred findings only, when fixed — §7)).
- IDs are immutable once merged to the integration branch; renaming before merge (on the owning branch) is fine.
- Registries/indexes enforce slug uniqueness per class. A slug collision found at reconcile time is a probable duplicate (§10.4), not an error. Superseded artifacts keep their ID with `Status: superseded-by: <id>` — never delete an ID from a registry; references must not dangle.

### 10.2 Brain Reconcile (merge/pull ceremony)

**Triggers:** (1) **[STRICT] Pre-merge** — on a feature branch, before opening a PR or merging into the integration branch (`dev`, §6.12), sync that branch into yours, resolve conflicts, and reconcile against it (§0.6), so dedupe lands BEFORE the textual conflict. (2) **[CORE] Post-pull** — at session start, if incoming commits touched `.salvor/`, `VERSION.md`, `RULES.md`, or `.serena/memories/`, ask verbatim:

> "Incoming brain changes detected — run brain reconcile? (yes/no)"

**Procedure:** three-way diff (merge base / ours / theirs) over the brain surfaces → semantic comparison (§10.4) → per-surface resolution. Every merge/augment/supersede of durable knowledge is operator-gated, verbatim:

> "Merge these two <class> artifacts into one? (yes/no)"

| Surface | Resolution rule |
|---------|-----------------|
| Artifacts (DL / DEC / PM / LF specs) | Winner absorbs loser with a provenance block; loser becomes a one-line redirect stub (`superseded-by:`). |
| `.salvor/DOMAIN_REF.md` | Single current truth — contradictions resolve to ONE `Status: live` entry; loser marked superseded with date + why. |
| L1 (`.salvor/active_state.md`) | NEVER textually merged — re-synthesize from both sides' L2 + artifacts after resolution (≤50 lines). |
| L2 (`.salvor/active_state_verbose.md`) | Union both sides, normalize to chronological order, collapse duplicate sections. |
| Index READMEs + `DEFERRED_TODOS.md` | Union rows, re-sort, dedupe. For `DEFERRED_TODOS.md` and `archive/DEFERRED_TODOS.md`, dedupe by ID; when both sides hold the same ID, `closed` or `archived` wins over `live`. (Optional `.gitattributes` `merge=union` convenience — reconcile normalizes regardless.) |
| `RULES.md` | Governance — conflicting edits to Salvor-managed sections are ALWAYS operator-decided; never auto-merged. |
| `.serena/memories/` | Derived views — re-derive from the reconciled canonical artifacts; never merge textually. |
| Spoke `CLAUDE.md` | Update knowledge references to the reconciled IDs; [STRICT] build lines per §3 integration bump. |
| `VERSION.md` | [STRICT] §3 integration bump: assign real numbers to `pending` rows — one bump per component per integration. |

End with the standard confirmation report (every touched file).

### 10.3 Brain Audit (recurring semantic self-audit)

Reconcile only sees what a merge brings in; duplicates also accrete on a single branch or pre-date the protocol.

- **Cadence:** due every **3 days** — `AUDIT_INTERVAL_DAYS = 3`, operator-tunable (beta default; feedback welcome on the default and its configurability). Tracked by the `## Last Brain Audit:` line in L1. At session start, if overdue, ask verbatim:

> "Brain audit is due (last run N days ago) — run it now? (yes/no)"

- **Sweep:** the §10.4 comparison run all-pairs across the whole brain, plus: contradiction check against DOMAIN_REF current truth; missing/empty Subject/Claim headers; stale L1 lines, including L1 references to `deferred:` IDs that are `closed`, `archived`, or missing from the ledger; dangling or superseded cross-links; aging `live` deferred findings; L1 ≤50-line and L2 rotation checks.
- Findings route through the same classification + operator gates as §10.2. Update the L1 audit line and land the run as an ordinary commit.

### 10.4 Semantic comparison (never filename-only)

1. **Pair by Subject:** for each new/changed artifact, collect every existing artifact (any class, any date) sharing ≥1 Subject tag. Subject overlap — not name similarity — is the pairing key.
2. **Compare Claims** (read both artifacts in full): same claim, compatible evidence → **duplicate** (merge into one — keep the richer body, union evidence, one live ID); compatible claims, different facets → **overlapping** (augment the canonical one); incompatible claims → **contradictory** (operator decision required, presented with both evidence dates and a newest-evidence presumption; exactly ONE `Status: live` entry survives); one retests/upgrades the other → **supersedes** (v1 → v2 per §6.9 atomicity).
3. No pair → **distinct** — keep as-is.

### 10.5 [EXPERIMENTAL] Agentic provisional capture — default OFF

**Config: `AGENT_CAPTURE = off`** (operator-tunable: `off` | `provisional`). **Beta feature under active calibration** — graduation criteria are tracked publicly (see CONTRIBUTING). When `off` (the default), nothing changes: ALL durable capture remains user-gated per §2/§7, and agents never write durable knowledge without the verbatim prompt.

When the operator sets `provisional`:

- **Trust tier.** Agents may create durable artifacts without the per-item gate, but every such artifact enters a visibly lower trust tier. Its structured header carries two extra provenance fields: `Contributed-by: agent — <vendor/model>, <date>` and `Review: unreviewed`. Human-gated captures carry `Contributed-by: operator-approved` and no `Review:` field (the capture gate itself is the ratification). Provenance is plain Markdown data — it must survive any vendor switch and never rely on vendor-specific state.
- **Per-class policy.** Allowed provisionally: **Deferred Findings**, **Domain Learnings**, and **Learned Failures** — with the `Claim:` and evidence content mandatory (no evidence, no capture). **Design Decisions:** agents may only file proposals (`Review: proposed`); a `DEC:` never becomes governing rationale without human ratification. **RULES changes: never agentic** (§10.2 governance), under any setting.
- **Consumption rule (all vendors).** Treat `Review: unreviewed` knowledge as *hypothesis, not invariant*: cite its provenance when acting on it, never let it relax a rule, and never let it override ratified knowledge. An unreviewed↔ratified contradiction resolves automatically in favor of the ratified entry pending review — no operator interrupt.
- **L1 marking.** Any L1 shorthand derived from unreviewed knowledge carries a `(prov)` tag until ratification. L1 is auto-loaded context; it must never launder provisional claims into apparent truth.
- **Commit trailer.** Commits introducing agent contributions carry the trailer `Salvor-Contribution: agent`. Header and trailer must agree — a mismatch is an audit red flag.
- **Ratification.** The Brain Audit (§10.3) enumerates every `Review: unreviewed` / `Review: proposed` artifact by scanning headers (no separate ledger — derived, conflict-free) and presents each through the §10.4 classification with the verbatim gate:
  > "Ratify this agent contribution? (yes / no / archive)"
  `yes` → `Review: ratified`, drop the L1 `(prov)` tags; `no` → one-line redirect stub stays in place, full content moves to the archive (§10.6); `archive` → moved untouched for later review. Review each item individually — bulk ratification defeats the tier.

### 10.6 [EXPERIMENTAL] Archive — `.salvor/archive/`

Unreviewed knowledge is parked, never silently discarded — the same principle as deferred findings, one tier down.

- **Layout:** mirrors the live folder structure (`archive/domain-learnings/`, `archive/decisions/`, `archive/postmortems/`). An archived artifact keeps its ID and full content; the live registry keeps a one-line `Status: archived` pointer (never delete an ID — §10.1). Deferred findings are entries, not files: an archived one moves in full to `archive/DEFERRED_TODOS.md`, and the live ledger keeps its heading with the `Status: archived` pointer.
- **Aging:** `ARCHIVE_AFTER_DAYS = 90` (operator-tunable). The Brain Audit surfaces unreviewed contributions older than the window with the verbatim gate:
  > "Archive N stale unreviewed contributions? (yes/no)"
  **Ratified knowledge never ages out** — it lives until superseded.
- **Load rule:** agents never read `.salvor/archive/` unless explicitly instructed (same contract as L2). The archive optimizes attention, not disk — git history retains everything regardless.
- **Un-archive:** late ratification moves the artifact back and flips `Review:`; references never dangled because the ID persisted.
- **Offloading** (e.g. object storage) is out of core scope — community integrations welcome; Salvor itself installs no hooks.
